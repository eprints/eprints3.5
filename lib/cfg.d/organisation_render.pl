=item $xhtmlfragment = organisation_render( $organisation, $repository, $preview )

This subroutine takes an organisation object and renders the XHTML view
of this organisation for public viewing.

Takes two arguments: the L<$organisation|EPrints::DataObj::Organisation> to render
and the current L<$repository|EPrints::Session>.

Returns a list of ( C<$page>, C<$title>[, C<$links>[, C<$template>]] )
where C<$page>, C<$title> and C<$links> are XHTML DOM objects and
C<$template> is a string containing the name of the template to use
for this page.

If $preview is true then this is only being shown as a preview. The 
C<$template> isn't honoured in this situation. (This is used to stop 
the "edit organisation" link appearing when it makes no sense.)
