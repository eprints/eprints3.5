# EPrints Classic Style

> Introduced in EPrints 3.5 for systems designed heavily using the old layout and do not wish to change.
> Dec 2023

This ingredient is designed to eclipse bootstrap integrations with the old (EPrints3.4 or older) default styling. It does this by providing a like for like mirror of the classic EPrints look within the modern EPrints 3.5 XML rendering phrases.

Contained within the ingredient will be many of the `.css` or `.js` files used for the classic EPrints styling which are no longer required now that core is using Bootstrap classes and componant layouts. If your repository only uses parts of the old styling, it may be worth moving the specific files to archive level and removing this ingredient entirely.

If you want to use the old styling as a base, then you can find the template and xpage files under old_cfg/<flavour>/, copy these into your archive.
